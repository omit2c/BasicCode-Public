# BasicCode Public 
 Here you can find public code you can use for adding BasicCode to your website or other public places.

To make it very easy for you to link BasicCode on your website we have created a repository where you can find different buttons for links and more.
In case you need more assets please create an issue and we will take care of it as soon as possible.
